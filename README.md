# TechCo-eCommerce-Analysis
TechCo, founded in 2018, is a global eCommerce that provides popular consumer electronics to a worldwide customer base. In this project, I utilized the company's sales data to analyze its sales trends, average order value, and operational efficiency. 

I began by using Excel to investigate the company's North Star metrics to gain a high-level view of its performance trends. I then used SQL in BigQuery to make targeted insights and recommendations to specific teams in the company.  

Key Areas  
- Sales Trends
- Product and Region Performance 
- Loyalty Programme Effectiveness 
- Refund Rates and Average Order Value
